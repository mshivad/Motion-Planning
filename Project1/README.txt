The main python code is under graph_search.py file.

I have created a number of run_graph search file for each algorithms and sometimes for same algorithms running different actions. To get the run_graph_search_xyz file running, the name of this file should be mentioned in the "script" configuration of graph_search.py file.

To run either the Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance on the A* algorithm with different sets of actions, please comment the line that wouldnt be used.
